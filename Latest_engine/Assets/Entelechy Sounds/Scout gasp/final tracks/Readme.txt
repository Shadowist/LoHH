These tracks should be toggled to play when the shade gets close to a Scout.  
Basically, we have that little animation where the scout(s)jump in fear when 
the shade gets too close.  These tracks can play in sync with that animation.  

There are 2 tracks here and if possible they should be alternated for each scout that faints

ex: 

Scout 1 is caught > play Track 1
Scout 2 is caught > play Track 2
Scout 3 is caught > play Track 1
